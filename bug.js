This error typically occurs when you try to use a feature or library in Expo that isn't compatible with the version of React Native you're using.  For example, you may try to use a newer React Native library that requires a newer version of Expo, or vice versa.  Another cause might be a mismatch between your Expo SDK version and the dependencies specified in your `package.json`.  If the error message doesn't pinpoint a specific incompatibility, carefully examine your `package.json` for outdated or conflicting packages. Using `expo upgrade` might help.
