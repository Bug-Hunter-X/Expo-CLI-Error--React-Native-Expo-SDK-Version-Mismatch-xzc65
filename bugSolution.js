Several strategies can resolve version mismatches:

1. **Using `expo upgrade`:** This command attempts to upgrade your project to the latest compatible versions of Expo and its dependencies.  Run this command in your project's root directory:
```bash
expo upgrade
```

2. **Manually Updating Dependencies:**  Carefully review your `package.json` file's dependencies section. Ensure that the versions of `react-native`, `expo`, and other relevant packages are compatible with each other. You can use a package manager like npm or yarn to update individual packages if you need more control.
```bash
npm install react-native@latest // Or a specific version
yarn add react-native@latest // Or a specific version
```

3. **Cleaning the Project:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and run `npm install` or `yarn install` to clean the project and reinstall dependencies. This might help resolve any lingering conflicts between installed versions.

4. **Expo Compatibility Check:**  Expo's website provides compatibility information. Check this to make sure the versions of all packages are compatible with your project's requirements.
